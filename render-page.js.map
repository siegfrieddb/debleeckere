Deze foto kreeg een ereplaats in de woonkamers van de gezinsleden. In het\r\nmidden staan de ouders, Vital De Bleeckere en Maria Octavia Versluys, omringd door hun tien\r\nvolwassen kinderen. Het zijn kloksgewijs Omer, Alfons, Jozef, Maria, Irma, Berta, Albert,\r\nMaurits, Jules, Lea. Die volgorde is niet chronologisch. Het oudste kind was namelijk Jozef, de\r\nderde van de bovenste rij. Ook op de onderste rij staat links Albert voor Maurits, terwijl\r\nMaurits voor Albert geboren is. De chronologische volgorde is dus: Jozef, Maria, Alfons, Omer,\r\nIrma, Berta, Maurits, Albert, Jules en Lea. Op de foto ontbreekt er een kind. Het is Raymond,\r\nhet derde kind van het echtpaar Vital-Octavia.

fietser die onderweg is.

In de aparte rubriek Bronnen\r\n              worden alle bronnen die een rol spelen in de uitbouw van de site samengebracht en voorgesteld. \r\n              </div>\r\n

bevat vier domeinen.\r\n              <br/>\r\n              <br/>\r\n              Het domein <b>Familie</b> stelt de 13 personen voor, die samen de twee generaties van de familie vormen.\r\n              Het betreft de ouders Vitalis en Octavia en hun elf kinderen. Bij ieder van hen hoort een mozaïek met info die reikt tot aan hun kinderen.\r\n              Dat betekent dat de site over drie generaties handelt. In totaal gaat het om 37 personen die de naam De Bleeckere dragen.\r\n              Via de huwelijken van de kinderen en de kleinkinderen van Vitalis en Octavia komen daar ook andere families bij. \r\n              In de tijd gezien, situeren al de betrokken personen zich in het laatste kwart van de negentiende eeuw, de volledige twintigste eeuw \r\n              en in de eerste helft van de eenentwintigste eeuw. \r\n              <br/>\r\n              <br/>\r\n              Officiële stukken, beelden en teksten, bevinden zich in het domein <b>Documenten</b>. \r\n              Er gebeurt ook onderzoek naar de familie en haar omgeving in tijd en ruimte. Dat gebeurt in het domein <b>Onderzoek</b>. Het biedt\r\n              een platform om op bepaalde aspecten van de familie en haar omgeving dieper in te gaan. Dat domein is nauw verwant\r\n              aan het domein <b>Bakermat</b>. Dat belicht thema's die betrekking hebben op de historische, \r\n              geografische en maatschappelijke context van de familie. \r\n               <br/>\r\n               <br/>\r\n               De vier <br>domeinen</br> belichten een familie van Vlaamse volksmensen. Door hard samenwerken, \r\n               hebben ze stand gehouden doorheen de hevige stormen van het leven en de tijd. \r\n               De site benadert de familie De Bleeckere-Versluys als een concrete tijdspiegel. \r\n               De domeinen <br>Bakermat</br>, <br>Documenten</br> en <br>Onderzoek</br> beschrijven samen een hoofdstuk van ‘de geschiedenis van de gewone man en vrouw’ \r\n               in het Vlaanderen van eind negentiende – de volle twintigste eeuw. \r\n               Ze kunnen ook de interesse wekken van al wie een band heeft met het Meetjesland en het grensgebied tussen Oost- en West-Vlaanderen. \r\n               Dat geldt ook voor wie geboeid blijft door de historische turbulenties van de Eerste en de Tweede Wereldoorlog, \r\n               het Interbellum, de naoorlogse Wederopbouw in het Europa van de fifties en de sixties.                \r\n               <br/>\r\n               <br/>\r\n               Deze site is als een gebouw waaraan permanent wordt gewerkt. De ruwbouw is af. De concrete invulling\r\n               van de diverse verdiepingen - de vier domeinen - met hun vele kamers, \r\n               verloopt op het ritme van weken, maanden en jaren.\r\n              <br/>\r\n              <br/>\r\n              Wenst u op de hoogte te blijven van de verdere ontwikkeling van de site, <GatsbyLink to=\"contact\">zie bij Contact</GatsbyLink>.\r\n              <br/>\r\n               <br/>\r\n              <div style={{\"textAlign\": \"center\"}}>\r\n                <br/>\r\n                <span style={{\"color\":\"blue\"}}><i>I tell, therefore you are.
